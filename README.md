# Welcome to the Azure Certified Hybrid Workshop Demo content

This repository contains the set of scripts and code samples to be demoed and shared with partners onboarding the Azure Certified Hybrid program.

Over time there should be a sufficient set of examples, using all common methods of interacting with Azure, either via Powershell, API's and azure command line tools or manually through the Azure Portal UI and Microsoft Partner Center.

## How to contribute

I personally use Visual Studio Code and Github Desktop for Windows as the primary tools to interact with this content as they support Powershell, JSON, C# and Markdown formats combined with an easy and simple interface. However, any other tools such as Visual Studio 2015, Atom will also be adequate.

## Available Demo scenarios
The following tags [Powershell],[API],[XPLAT],[VS2015],[PORTAL] will be used to denote the presence of a specific code sample in each demo scenario.

*Commerce API/Partner Center*

*AzureAD* [Powershell]

This demo is required to configure access to the Azure Subscriptions for the demo tenants 1 and 2.

*Subscriptions* [Powershell]

This demo is required to select to the Azure Subscriptions for the demo tenant 1.

*2TierAOBO* [Powershell]

This demo contains the examples on configuring Admin-On-Behalf-Of for any UserRole (Provider or External) and allows CSP Partners to configure tiered partner scenarios.
